- 2D platformer pass the bomb inspired game using pygame and tools
- 
This is a chaotic, 2D platformer supporting 2-4 players on one keyboard. It's a high-pressure 'pass the bomb' survival game. The player holding the bomb is granted a dash ability, which they must use to tag and transfer the bomb to an opponent before the timer kills them. Other players are defenseless, focused only on escape. The only relief comes in the form of speed power-ups, natural map features, and skill-based evasion and game sense.
